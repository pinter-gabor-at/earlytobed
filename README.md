# Minecraft Fabric Early to Bed Mod

"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"

But when starting a new game in Minecraft you cannot go early to bed.
First you must kill three sheep with your bare hands or with a wooden sword.
Then you create a bed from the spoil of this brutal act and expect to sleep soundly. - Barbaric.

So I made this mod to allow a less violent start.
I have created a wooden shear.
It has pitifully low durability, barely enough to collect 3 wools for your first bed.

There is one more item to help you at the very beginning of a new game: the wooden bucket.
It is similar to a normal bucket, but made of wood, can hold only water, and does not interact with cauldrons.
