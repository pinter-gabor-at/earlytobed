# Minecraft Fabric Early to Bed Mod

"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"

But when starting a new game in Minecraft you cannot go early to bed.
First you must kill three sheep with your bare hands or with a wooden sword.
Then you create a bed from the spoil of this brutal act and expect to sleep soundly. - Barbaric.

So I made this mod to allow a less violent start.
Create a wooden shear.
It has a pitifully low durability, barely enough to collect 3 wools for your first bed.

Other items to help you at the very beginning of a new game:

* Wooden bucket

	Similar to normal bucket, but made of wood and can hold only water.

* Wooden saddle

	Similar to regular saddle, but it breaks apart when you take it off your horse.
